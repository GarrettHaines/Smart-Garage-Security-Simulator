# smart-garage-security-simulator
This Java application simulates a demonstration of a hypothetical "Smart Garage Door Security System" which uses a dual authentication procedure to prevent security vulnerabilities and verify authentic interactions with the door. This is done using a door that is connected to the user's WiFi network and an "Authenticator" application designed for a smartphone.
Attacks against two garage door security systems are also simulated to identify potential security threats. An attack against the "Smart Garage Door" system and the common garage door system, which uses a radio transmitter and receiver, are demonstrated.
These simulations are intended to demonstrate basic IoT security measures, particularly dual authentication.
